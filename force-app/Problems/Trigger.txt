Opportunity Trigger Problem 01:
REAL-WORLD PROBLEM: “Account & Opportunity Management”
Scenario (Business Context)
Your company has:
Accounts (customers)
Opportunities (deals)
Business Rule:
Whenever a new Opportunity is inserted or updated, we want to update the Account’s “Last_Deal_Date__c” field to the latest Opportunity CloseDate.
Only consider Opportunities where Stage = ‘Closed Won’.
If no closed won opportunities exist, leave Account unchanged.
